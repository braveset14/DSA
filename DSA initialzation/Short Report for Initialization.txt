1. Data Structures Used
std::string: to store the path of the repository directory.

<filesystem>: used to create and check the existence of directories.

2. Design Decisions
Used std::filesystem from C++17 to manage directory creation, as it's standard, cross-platform, and easier than using OS commands.

Kept initialization minimal to allow easy expansion for file tracking, commits, etc.

3. Limitations
Only creates a directory; doesn’t set up tracking structures or save metadata.

Doesn’t handle errors (e.g., permission issues, disk errors).

Doesn’t support reinitializing (no overwrite or clean options).

4. Future Improvements
Create subfolders inside .minigit/ for commits, branches, logs.

Add a configuration file to store initial settings.

Include metadata initialization (e.g., current branch, latest commit).

Log initialization date and user.
